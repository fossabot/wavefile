## About
**wavefile** is a JavaScript module to work with .wav files.

With **wavefile** you can:
- Create wave files from scratch
- Read existing .wav files
- Read and write tags on .wav files
- Set and delete cue points and their labels
- Encode/decode files as ADPCM, A-Law and Î¼-Law
- Turn RIFF files to RIFX and RIFX files to RIFF
- Create or edit BWF metadata ("bext" chunk)
- Change the bit depth of the audio

And more.

## Install
```
npm install wavefile
```

## Browser
Use the compiled file in the */dist* folder:
```html
<script src="wavefile-min.js"></script>
```

## See it in action

With **wavefile** you can change the bit depth and compression type of wav files on the fly before loading them in a browser player. This example uses **wavefile** and **wavesurfer** to create a browser player that supports mu-Law, A-Law, IMA ADPCM and all other formats supported by **wavefile**:

https://rochars.github.io/wavefile/example

```javascript
// Load a wav file that is encoded as 4-bit IMA ADPCM:
var wav = new WaveFile(ADPCMFileBuffer);

// Decode the file as 16-bit PCM, supported by most browsers:
wav.fromIMAADPCM();

// Get the DataURI of your new, browser-friendly wav file:
var wavDataURI = wav.toDataURI();

// Load your new wav file into your player
// ...
```

Check out wavesurfer:  
https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js

## Use
```javascript
// Load a wav file from disk into a WaveFile object
let wav = new WaveFile(buffer);

// Check some of the file properties
console.log(wav.container);
console.log(wav.chunkSize);
console.log(wav.fmt.chunkId);

// Call toBuffer() to get the bytes of the file.
// You can write the output straight to disk:
let wavBuffer = wav.toBuffer();

// Call toDataURI() to get the file as a DataURI:
let wavDataURI = wav.toDataURI();
```

### Create wave files from scratch
You must inform the number of channels, the sample rate, the bit depth and the samples (in this order).

#### Mono:
```javascript
let wav = new WaveFile();

// Create a mono wave file, 44.1 kHz, 32-bit and 4 samples
wav.fromScratch(1, 44100, '32', [0, -2147483648, 2147483647, 4]);
fs.writeFileSync(path, wav.toBuffer());
```

#### Stereo:
Samples can be informed interleaved or de-interleaved. If they are de-interleaved, WaveFile will interleave them. In this example they are de-interleaved.
```javascript
// Stereo, 48 kHz, 8-bit, de-interleaved samples
// WaveFile interleave the samples automatically
wav.fromScratch(2, 48000, '8', [
    [0, -2, 4, 3],
    [0, -1, 4, 3]
]);
fs.writeFileSync(path, wav.toBuffer());
```
Possible values for the bit depth are:  
"4" - 4-bit IMA-ADPCM  
"8" - 8-bit  
"8a" - 8-bit A-Law  
"8m" - 8-bit mu-Law  
"16" - 16-bit  
"24" - 24-bit  
"32" - 32-bit  
"32f" - 32-bit floating point  
"64" - 64-bit floating point

You can also use any bit depth between "8" and "53", like **"11", "12", "17", "20" and so on**.

#### A word on bit depth
Resolutions other than 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit (integer), 32-bit (fp) and 64-bit (fp) are implemented as WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE and may not be supported by some players.

### Interleave and de-interleave stereo samples
Samples in WaveFile objects are interleaved by default, even when you create a WaveFile object using de-interleaved samples.

You can de-interleave them:
```javascript
// De-interleave the samples into multiple channels
wav.deInterleave();
```

To interleave them:
```javascript
// Interleave stereo samples
wav.interleave();
```

### Add RIFF tags to files
You can create (or overwrite) tags on files with the **WaveFile.setTag()** method.
```javascript
// Write the ICMT tag with some comments to the file
wav.setTag("ICMT", "some comments");
```

To get the value of a tag (if it exists), use **WaveFile.getTag()**:
```javascript
console.log(wav.getTag("ICMT"));
// some comments
```

You can delete a tag with **WaveFile.deleteTag()**:
```javascript
wav.deleteTag("ICMT");
```

### Add cue points to files
You can create cue points using the **WaveFile.setCuePoint()** method. The method takes time in milliseconds, a text label and creates a cue point in the corresponding position of the file:
```javascript
wav.setCuePoint(1750, "some label for the cue point");
```

To delete a cue point use **WaveFile.deleteCuePoint()** informing the index of the point. Points are ordered according to their position. The first point is indexed as 1.
```javascript
wav.deleteCuePoint(1);
```

Mind that creating or deleting cue points will change the index of other points if they exist.

### RIFX
**wavefile** can handle existing RIFX files and create RIFX files from scratch. Files created from scratch will default to RIFF; to create a file as RIFX you must define the container:
```javascript
wav.fromScratch(1, 48000, '16', [0, 1, -32768, 32767], {"container": "RIFX"});
```

RIFX to RIFF and RIFF to RIFX:
```javascript
// Turn a RIFF file to a RIFX file
wav.toRIFX();

// Turn a RIFX file to a RIFF file
wav.toRIFF();
```

### IMA-ADPCM
16-bit 8000 Hz mono wave files can be compressed as IMA-ADPCM:
```javascript
// Encode a 16-bit wave file as 4-bit IMA-ADPCM:
wav.toIMAADPCM();
```
IMA-ADPCM files compressed with **wavefile** will have a block align of 256 bytes.

If the audio is not 16-bit it will be converted to 16-bit before compressing. Compressing audio with sample rate different from 8000 Hz or more than one channel is not supported and will throw errors.

To decode 4-bit IMA-ADPCM as 16-bit linear PCM:
```javascript
// Decode 4-bit IMA-ADPCM as 16-bit:
wav.fromIMAADPCM();
```

Decoding always result in 16-bit audio. To decode to another bit depth:
```javascript
// Decode 4-bit IMA-ADPCM as 24-bit:
wav.fromIMAADPCM("24");
```

### A-Law
16-bit wave files (mono or stereo) can be encoded as A-Law:
```javascript
// Encode a 16-bit wave file as 8-bit A-law:
wav.toALaw();
```
If the audio is not 16-bit it will be converted to 16-bit before compressing.

To decode 8-bit A-Law as 16-bit linear PCM:
```javascript
// Decode 8-bit A-Law as 16-bit:
wav.fromALaw();
```

Decoding always result in 16-bit audio. To decode to another bit depth:
```javascript
// Decode 8-bit A-Law as 24-bit:
wav.fromALaw("24");
```

### mu-Law
16-bit wave files (mono or stereo) can be encoded as mu-Law:
```javascript
// Encode a 16-bit wave file as 8-bit mu-law:
wav.toMuLaw();
```
If the audio is not 16-bit it will be converted to 16-bit before compressing.

To decode 8-bit mu-Law as 16-bit linear PCM:
```javascript
// Decode 8-bit mu-Law as 16-bit:
wav.fromMuLaw();
```

Decoding always result in 16-bit audio. To decode to another bit depth:
```javascript
// Decode 8-bit mu-Law as 24-bit:
wav.fromMuLaw("24");
```

### Change the bit depth
You can change the bit depth of the audio with the **toBitDepth(bitDepth)** method.
```javascript
// Load a wav file with 32-bit audio
let wav = new WaveFile(fs.readFileSync("32bit-file.wav"));

// Change the bit depth to 24-bit
wav.toBitDepth("24");

// Write the new 24-bit file
fs.writeFileSync("24bit-file.wav", wav.toBuffer());
```

### Add BWF metadata
To add BWF data to a file you can use the **bext** property:
```javascript
// Load a wav file with no "bext"
let wav = new WaveFile(fs.readFileSync("32bit-file.wav"));

// Add some BWF metadata
wav.bext.originator = "wavefile";

// Write the new BWF file
fs.writeFileSync("32bit-file-with-bext.wav", wav.toBuffer());
```

By default **wavefile** will not insert a "bext" chunk in new files or in files that do not already have a "bext" chunk unless a property of **WaveFile.bext** is changed from it's default value. See below the full list of properties in **WaveFile.bext**.

## Main methods

### WaveFile.fromBuffer()
Load a .wav file from a byte buffer into a WaveFile object:
```javascript
wav.fromBuffer(buffer);
```

This is the same as passing the buffer when creating the WaveFile object:
```javascript
let wav = new WaveFile(buffer);
```

### WaveFile.fromScratch()
Create a wave file from scratch:
```javascript
// A mono, 44.1 kHz, 32-bit .wav file with just 4 samples:
wav.fromScratch(1, 44100, '32', [0, -2147483648, 2147483647, 4]);
```

### WaveFile.toBuffer()
Return a Uint8Array with the WaveFile object data. The buffer is a .wav file and can be written to disk:
```javascript
buffer = wav.toBuffer();
```

### WaveFile.toDataURI()
Return a DataURI string with the WaveFile object data. The DataURI is a .wav file and can be played in browsers:
```javascript
wavDataURI = wav.toDataURI();
```

### WaveFile.setCuePoint()
Set a cue point with a text label in the file. The point position is informed in milliseconds:
```javascript
wav.setCuePoint(1750, "some label");
```

### WaveFile.deleteCuePoint()
Delete a cue point. The cue point is identified by its order on the file (first point is 1):
```javascript
// remove the first cue point and its label
wav.deleteCuePoint(1);
```

### WaveFile.updateLabel()
Update the label text of a cue point. The cue point is identified by its order on the file (first point is 1):
```javascript
// Update the label of the second cue point
wav.updateLabel(2, "updated label");
```

### WaveFile.setTag()
Create (or overwrite) a RIFF tag in the file:
```javascript
wav.setTag("ICMT", "some comments");
```

### WaveFile.getTag()
Return the value of a existing RIFF tag:
```javascript
wav.getTag("ICMT");
```

### WaveFile.deleteTag()
Remove a tag from the file:
```javascript
wav.deleteTag("ICMT");
```

console.log(wav.smpl.dwNumSampleLoops);
console.log(wav.smpl.dwSamplerData);
console.log(wav.smpl.loops);

// "LIST" chunk
console.log(wav.LIST);
```

### BWF data
BWF data ("bext" chunk) is stored in the *bext* property.
```javascript
WaveFile.bext = {
    "chunkId": "",
    "chunkSize": 0,
    "description": "",
    "originator": "",
    "originatorReference": "",
    "originationDate": "",
    "originationTime": "",
    "timeReference": [0, 0],
    "version": 0,
    "UMID": "",
    "loudnessValue": 0,
    "loudnessRange": 0,
    "maxTruePeakLevel": 0,
    "maxMomentaryLoudness": 0,
    "maxShortTermLoudness": 0,
    "reserved": "",
    "codingHistory": ""
};
```

### Cue points
Items in *cue.points* are objects that look like this:
```javascript
{
    "dwName": 0, // a cue point ID
    "dwPosition": 0,
    "fccChunk": 0,
    "dwChunkStart": 0,
    "dwBlockStart": 0,
    "dwSampleOffset": 0,
}
```

### Sample loops
Items in *smpl.loops* are objects that look like this:
```javascript
{
    "dwName": "", // a cue point ID
    "dwType": 0,
    "dwStart": 0,
    "dwEnd": 0,
    "dwFraction": 0,
    "dwPlayCount": 0,
}
```

### LIST chunk
"LIST" chunk data is stored as follows:
```javascript
/**
 * An array of the "LIST" chunks present in the file.
 * @type {!Array<!Object>}
 */
WaveFile.LIST = [];
```

*WaveFile.LIST* is an array of objects with this signature:
```javascript
{
    /** @type {string} */
    "chunkId": "", // always 'LIST'
    /** @type {number} */
    "chunkSize": 0,
    /** @type {string} */
    "format": "", // 'adtl' or 'INFO'
    /** @type {!Array<!Object>} */
    "subChunks": []
};
```
Where "subChunks" are the subChunks of the "LIST" chunk. A single file may have many "LIST" chunks as long as their formats ("INFO", "adtl", etc) are not the same. **wavefile** can read and write "LIST" chunks of format "INFO" and "adtl".

For "LIST" chunks with the "INFO" format, "subChunks" will be an array of objects with this signature:
```javascript
{
    /** @type {string} */
    "chunkId": "" // some RIFF tag
    /** @type {number} */
    "chunkSize" 0,
    /** @type {string} */
    "value": ""
}
```
Where "chunkId" may be any RIFF tag:  
https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/RIFF.html#Info

### ds64 chunk
**wavefile** have limited support of RF64 files. Changing the bit depth or applying compression to the samples will result in a RIFF file.

"ds64" data is stored as follows:
```javascript
wav.ds64 = {
    "chunkId": "",
    "chunkSize": 0,
    "riffSizeHigh": 0,
    "riffSizeLow": 0,
    "dataSizeHigh": 0,
    "dataSizeLow": 0,
    "originationTime": 0,
    "sampleCountHigh": 0,
    "sampleCountLow": 0
};
```

## The samples
Range:
- 0 to 255 for 8-bit
- -32768 to 32767 for 16-bit
- -8388608 to 8388607 for 24-bit
- -2147483648 to 2147483647 for 32-bit
- -1.0 to 1.0 for 32-bit (float)
- -1.0 to 1.0 for 64-bit (float)
